This is a personal project in which I attempt to solve most if not all of the exercises in the book Topology Second Edition by Munkres. 
The  TeX template I use for this is one I took from one of my prevous courses, sadly I cannot provide proper credit as it has been many years
since this file sat in my computer and many more since I attended such courses. 

I cannot fully acertain that all of my answers are completely accurate, only that they are enough to convince me of the veracity
of the claims I am proving for the exercises. My writing may not be best for most people -- that is something I aim to better as 
I get further along in this project. There is no timeline in regard for when certain solutions will be published or of when this
project will be finished, this is a personal project after all and the work I do is meant to relax me (and to be done when I so
feel like it).

If anyone does find this project, I hope you find some joy maybe not within my solutions but hopefully within the problems I am
tackling in this book. Topology is quite nice after all.
